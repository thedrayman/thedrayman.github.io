## Personal
Hi! I'm Fabian and a computer scientist, system administrator and IT security enthusiast.

I'm a former student of computer science in the Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science at [University of Kassel](https://www.uni-kassel.de/eecs/en/ "Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science- Universtiy of Kassel"). My main focus as a Master student was communication and distributed systems with a focus on information security.

In my free time, I likes music, movies, sport and time with friends and family. Furthermore, from time to time I go on a Geocaching trip. I'm voluntary working for a sports club.
